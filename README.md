## Synopsis
This is a project designed to help me learn about OpenGL.

## Motivation
This project was created so I could get some practice with implementing OpenGL in a game like context.

##Installation
All the source files are included in the project. You will have to configure the project to work with your system. 

You can follow this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGptI11wRxE) by Sonar Systems to setup your enviornment in Visual Studio on Windows. This project will not be supporting Mac OSX because Apple does not support the OpenGL 4.5 implementation on its systems.

## Contributors 
If you want to contribute, please submit a pull request with your changes. More information can be found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

## License
This project uses the MIT license. This essentially means that if you use code from the project then you need to credit it in your product some way. More information can be found [here](http://choosealicense.com/).

## Tools Used In Project
[OpenGL, Version 4.5](https://www.opengl.org/)

[Visual Studio 2015 Community](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx)

[GLEW, Version 1.13.0](http://glew.sourceforge.net/)

[GLFW, Version 3.1.2](http://www.glfw.org/)

[GLM, Version 0.9.7.3](http://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.7/index.html)

## Tutorials And Books
If you are interested in OpenGL tutorials check out the videos from [Sonar Systems](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRtjMdoYXLf4yTkXgyRBy5LXTFhdU7LWq) and [MakingGamesWithBen](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSPw4ASQYyymu3PfG9gxywSPghnSMiOAW). They both are incredibly talented YouTubers who have a lot to share about OpenGL and my project will surely be using some code from their tutorials. 

I will also be using the book OpenGL Supper Bible Seventh Edition by Graham Sellers, Richard S. Wright and Nicholas Haemel. It's website can be found [here](http://www.openglsuperbible.com/).

# Thanks from the Author
I would like to thank all the people I mentioned in the "Tutorials And Books" section. Without their efforts, I would be unable to pursue my curiosity into OpenGL. 

I would also like to thank this [site](http://antongerdelan.net/opengl/hellotriangle.html) for helping me bridge the gap between GLFW and GLEW.
